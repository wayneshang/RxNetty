/**
 * A handler to insert {@link ServerSentEventDecoder} at a proper position in the pipeline according to the protocol. <br/>
 * There are the following cases, this handles:
 *
 * <h1>Http response with chunked encoding</h1>
 * In this case, the {@link ServerSentEventDecoder} is inserted after this {@link SSEInboundHandler}
 *
 * <h1>Http response with no chunking</h1>
 * In this case, the {@link ServerSentEventDecoder} is inserted as the first handler in the pipeline. This makes the
 * {@link ByteBuf} at the origin to be converted to {@link io.reactivex.netty.protocol.text.sse.ServerSentEvent} and hence any other handler will not look at this
 * message unless it is really interested.
 * <h3>Caveat</h3>
 * In some cases where any message is buffered before this pipeline change is made by this handler (i.e. adding
 * {@link ServerSentEventDecoder} as the first handler), the {@link ServerSentEventDecoder} will not be applied to those
 * messages. For this reason we also add {@link ServerSentEventDecoder} after this handler. In cases, where the first
 * {@link ServerSentEventDecoder} is applied on the incoming data, the next instance of {@link ServerSentEventDecoder}
 * will be redundant.
 *
 * <h1>No HTTP protocol</h1>
 * In this case, the handler does not do anything, assuming that there is no special handling required.
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link SseChannelHandler} instead.
